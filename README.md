👋 Hi, I'm @ClearSpaces, a passionate developer and mathematician from Mexico. I'm a proud recipient of a prestigious scholarship in Mexico, which has fueled my passion for technology and mathematics.

👀 I’m interested in a wide range of topics, from Algebra to AI and Machine Learning. I love exploring new areas and expanding my knowledge.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Discrete Mathematics and Number Theory, diving deeper into the fascinating world of complex numbers and prime numbers.

💻 I have proficiency in Python, Go, Java, and Kotlin. I enjoy using these languages to solve complex problems and build innovative solutions.

🔍 My company, Clear Spaces, is currently under construction. We aim to provide clear, efficient, and effective solutions to complex problems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage my skills in programming and mathematics. I'm particularly interested in projects that intersect with AI and ML.
